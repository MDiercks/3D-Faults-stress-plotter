# 3D-Faults-stress-plotter
A MATLAB App to plot Coulomb stress changes calculated with Coulomb 3.3+ on 3D fault networks created with the 3D-faults (v.2.4+) code. Outputs statistics on cumulative stress.

The calculates cumulative coseismic and interseismic Coulomb Stress Transfers (CST) based on outputs of the Coulomb 3.3+ software. TO use the app, first generate a 3D-Fault network and slip distribution with the main "3D-faults" code, then calculate CST with Coulomb.

## Inputs:
* folder containing the csv files generated by "Coulomb". It's recommended to name the files YYYYMMDD_SS_EVENTNAME, where SS is the scenario number, so the app can read the relevant data automatically
* folder containing the 3D-faults geometry, this is generated by the 3D-faults code by ticking the "export fault geometry" checkbox. All events must be modelled on the exact same fault network (same number of fault elements).
* to model interseismic loading, a "Coulomb"-generated csv file containing annual CST loading needs to be imported, again on the same fault network

## Outputs
The code plots the CST on the 3D-Fault network and outputs basic statistics on the cumulative stress on the fault network.

## Scenarios
If more than one scenario is available for at least one earthquake, the code automatically calculates all possible combinations of scenarios.

## Current issues
This is the first stable version of the code. Several features will be added in the future. Current limitations are:
* only one earthquake can be modelled per year, all cumulative CST is modelled annually
* code has not been thoroughly bug-tested
